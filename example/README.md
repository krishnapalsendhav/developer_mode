## Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `developer_mode` plugin to check for:
- Jailbroken/rooted devices
- Developer mode enabled or emulator detection

### Running the example

```bash
cd example
flutter run
```

The app will display the security status of your device with a clean UI showing whether the device is jailbroken/rooted or has developer mode enabled.
